    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>Hello! I'm Roshan Zameer — an enthusiastic and curious beginner developer passionate about learning how software systems work at their core. I am currently building my foundation in programming with a focus on C++, Python, and frontend development.</p>
      <p>I have a strong interest in operating systems, command-line tools, and understanding how low-level components interact with hardware. Even though I am at an early stage in my coding journey, my dedication to improving daily and experimenting with new technologies keeps me progressing steadily.</p>
      <p>One of my most memorable experiences was participating in a hybrid hackathon, where my team and I built a functioning mobile app. This experience taught me teamwork, idea execution, problem-solving under pressure, and how to think like a developer.</p>
      <p>My goal is to learn best practices, write clean and efficient code, contribute to team projects, and explore advanced OS concepts such as process management, memory handling, and system-level programming.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Hybrid Hackathon App</h3>
      <p>This app was developed during a hybrid hackathon event where teamwork, creativity, and quick thinking were essential. I contributed to the app's functionality, layout ideas, and implementation steps. This project helped me understand practical development workflows and how features evolve from ideas into functional components.</p>
      <p>Technologies involved: Basic app development tools, UI planning, and collaborative version control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Beginner Web Experiments</h3>
      <p>I have created small web-based projects to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. These include simple UI layouts, interactive buttons, and responsive structures. These experiments help me improve visually and think more creatively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Command-Line Practice</h3>
      <p>I frequently practice using command-line tools to understand how systems work under the hood. This includes directory navigation, file handling, running scripts, and exploring basic shell concepts.</p>
